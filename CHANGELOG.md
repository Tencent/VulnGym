# Changelog

All notable changes to VulnGym are documented here.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.3] — 2026-06-18

Data refresh — further expansion of human-audited coverage and broad annotation refinements.

### Changed
- Human-audited entries grew from **274 → 350 / 408** (85.8 %),
  covering **163 / 184** advisories (88.6 %).

### Added
- `desc` field on the `entry_point`, `critical_operation`, and `trace`
  nodes of **400** entries — a natural-language explanation of each
  node's role in the vulnerability chain.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **350** (was 274)
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **163** (was 137)

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-31

Data refresh — significant expansion of human-audited coverage and annotation refinements.

### Changed
- Human-audited entries grew from **113 → 274 / 408** (67.2 %),
  covering **137 / 184** advisories (74.5 %).
- Refined `entry_point`, `critical_operation`, and `trace` annotations
  on **80** entries for improved accuracy.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **274** (was 113)
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **137** (was 61)

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-15

Data refresh — adds a human-audit flag and additional human-verified entries.

### Added
- `verify` field on every row in `data/entries.jsonl` (`int`, `0` or `1`):
  `1` marks entries that have been reviewed and confirmed by a human
  annotator (high-confidence ground truth); `0` marks automatically
  annotated entries that have not yet been human-confirmed.
- **113 / 408** entries (≈ 27.7 %) are now flagged `verify = 1`,
  covering **61 / 184** advisories (≈ 33.2 %; **50** advisories have all
  of their entries verified, **11** are partially verified).

### Changed
- Refined values of selected `entry_point`, `critical_operation`, `trace`,
  and other annotation fields in `data/entries.jsonl`. Row counts and the
  `report_id` ↔ `entry_id` join structure are unchanged.
- `SCHEMA.md` now documents `verify`; `human_confirmed` is removed from
  the "intentionally omitted internal fields" invariant since the audit
  status is exposed publicly via `verify`.

### Stats
- reports: **184** (unchanged)
- entries: **408** (unchanged)
- human-audited entries (verify = 1): **113**
- human-audited advisories (≥ 1 verified entry): **61**
